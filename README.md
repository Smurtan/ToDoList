# ToDoList
"You don't have to be great to start, but to become great you have to start." Zig Ziglar
And you need to start with the simple, going to the complex.

I wrote the usual console application "To-do List", in which you can add and delete tasks, view the entire list. Unfortunately, it has no practical application now.
I try to use OOP in all projects, and this one is no exception. Even if it is implemented somehow, I study and practice.
